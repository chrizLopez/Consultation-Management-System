# Consultation-Management-System

Management system for Consultations specifically for teachers. Admin can set accounts for the teachers where students could set a realtime request for consultation for teachers.
Once the student sends a request to the teacher a notification would pop in to the teacher as long as he/she is logged in. Also teachers could add custom events and class schedules to a calendar and students could view this so they would know when are the vacant schedules of the teacher. 
Teachers could add announcements and the students could view it.
